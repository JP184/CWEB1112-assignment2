MPLS Dog Boarding Compute Rate Program

The MPLS Dogboarding academy wants to incorporate functionality that allows the end-user to select add-on services such as grooming and bathing to be included within the total cost of the dog's stay. At the conclusion of the program, the program will output the total number of days the dog will stay, the amenities selected and the total cost.

 (Links to an external site.)Requirements
Construct a program that allows the end-user to input the number of days the dog will stay and an add-on code. Include two overloaded methods named computeRate(). One version accepts an argument that includes the number of days and calculates the rate at $75.00 per day. The other accepts two arguments - the number of days and a code for add-on services. If the code is A, bathing and grooming will be included, and the price is $169.00 per day. If the code is C, only bathing is included, and the price is $112.00 per day. All other codes are invalid. Each method returns the rate to the calling program where it is displayed. The main program asks the user for the number of days in a stay and whether add-on services should be included; then, based on the userâ€™s response, the program either calls the first method or prompts for a add-on services code and calls the second method. At the conclusion of the program, the program outputs the number of days, the add-on services code and the total cost of stay.
